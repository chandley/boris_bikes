Boris Bikes exercise

We are creating a simple system for managing Boris Bikes in London. Our system will keep track of a number of docking stations and the bikes. It will allow you to rent the bikes and return them. Occasionally the bikes will break and then they will be unavailable for rental. There will also be a garage to fix the bikes and a van to move the bikes between the stations and the garage.

THere is a module BikeContainer for the functionality in common to anything which holds/gives/recieves a bike.

I've attempted the exercise more than once on separate threads. The 'master' thread may not be the latest attempt!
